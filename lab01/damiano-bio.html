        Hello! My name is Sofia Damiano and I am a sophomore in the School of Information Studies at Syracuse University. I am majoring in Information Management and Technology with a minor in Public Communications. I am hoping to concentrate in Digital Retail Strategies where I will be able to peruse a career in the eCommerce field, hopefully working somewhere in fashion. On campus, I am apart of Kappa Theta Pi, the professional technology fraternity, and Phi Sigma Sigma. In my free time you can find me listening to music and/or reading or watching movies. I love collecting old vinyl and I try to travel wherever that may be, any chance I get!
