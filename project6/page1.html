                <li>Grooves: The physical indentations of the record that produce the sound of the music. </li>
                <li>RPM: Revolutions per minute, or how many times the record will spin per minute. The size and amounts of groove on a singular record, will affect how fast the record needs to spin to play music </li>

            <h3>A Brief History of Vinyl</h3> 
            <img src="/project6/images/page1pic2.jpg" class="pic2" alt="albumcovers">                
            <p>The first vinyl record was introduced in 1948 by Columbia Records. Before vinyl, records were made with shellac and before that, zinc and glass. After much trial and error, vinyl has become a lasting staple in many homes, to this day. Records play on three speeds 78, 45, and 33 rpm. Most record players are still produced to accommodate records of all speeds, but newer records are usually 33/45 rpm. Records began to get competition in 1962 when cassette were created and in 1982, CDs were introduced into society, which allowed for a more portable way to listen to music, making records less popular. As time has gone on, the demand for records have begun to rise again, and many continue to collect and play records to this day!</p>

            <h3>How to Use</h3>
            <img src="/project6/images/player.jpg" class="pic3" alt="recordplayer">
            <p>It is important to use your vinyl correctly when playing them to avoid scratching or damaging them! Each basic record player is equipped with a turntable, that holds the vinyl record and spins it at a constant speed. The next part used is the arm of the machine, it contains the needle, which is the point that directly touches the records, and basically how the music is produced. The needle runs through the grooves of the record as it is moving, which creates vibrations. These vibrations are transmitted through the arm into the cartridge. The cartridge transforms these vibrations into an electrical signal that produces the sound that is outputted through the speaker, and thatâ€™s the music you hear!<br> Source: https://toprecordplayers.com/how-to-use-a-record-player/ </p>
