            <h3 class="centeredtext">This weeks album spolight is one of my favorite of all times: Fleetwood Mac's infamous Rumours.</h3>
            <p>The British-American band Fleetwood Mac's historic 11th studio album, was released on February 4th 1977. Winning the Grammy for Album of the year, went platnium 20 times, and spent 962 weeks on the charts, this award winning album is no joke, and hold some of my personal favorite songs of all times, including "Dreams" and "The Chain." Nearly 45 years later, and this album continues to sell physical and digital copies to this day. Its newfound popularity with new generations is thanks to the infamously timless nature of its pieces. There is no doubt these songs were feuled by some serious drama, and you could say the behind the scenes stories are just as good as the songs itself. I mean only some deep-rooted emotions could produce those brutally honesty lyrics that are showcased in all the songs. It is said that this record was almot not recorded, as bandmembers Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham could not stand to be in the same room together, and members Christine and John McVie were freshly divorced. But that is in fact not the case, and the band memebers united for the sole reason of creating and producing this album. It is said that Buckingham and Nicks were in constant argument, and only ceased their yelling when the recording light was on. How then, could such a powerful and compelling album come from such sadness and anger? The emotions that took place in that recording studio is forever ingrained into these songs, and will live on in infamy, and each song is a testimony to something each memeber was feeling at the time. Another reason why the album continues to attract the attention of so many, people can hear, and relate to what they are hearing, and resonate with the passion in the lyrics being sung. Well.... enough from me, I can rave on and on about this album if nobody stopped me, and I truly dare someone to find a flaw in this masterpice. But... this is your exact sign to go on and listen to it for yourself I want to know which song is your favorite! <br>

                    So you've seen all the tips and tricks, now where do you start? As recording collecting gains more and more populary, I'm seeing vinyl being sold anywhere from Urban Outfitters to Barnes and Noble. Records itself are pretty affordable usually pricing around $20-$30 dollars. If you're looking for the 'authentic' used vinyl with a little history behind it, and you are willing to take the chance of finding a few nicks and scratches, I would reccomend a record store, a little harder to find, but worth it in my opinion. One in the SYR area i'd reccommend is The Sound Garden-great vibes and lots of inventory. New or used - totally up to prefrence.<br>
                    Now, you can't listen to your records without a record player. Things get a little tricky here, but bottom line, you pay for the quality. There are some pretty pricey players on the market, but I've also found some very good quality players, and a really resonable price. My go-to, especially for a beginning is the Audio Technica brand. They have a lot of options, ranging in price, and are sold in a lot of places including amazon, urban outfitters, and their own site as well. My biggest reccomendation when shopping for a record player is to make sure not to buy players that have built in speakers. While I totally love the convience and visually pleasing apeal, you are sacraficing the sound quality, which in my opinion is one of the biggest points of having one in the first place. Along with that, they are known not to last as long, and also have the potential to damage your records. My personal opinon, I highly reccomend spending the money on a record player with an audio input, and connecting to any speaker that you have at home. <br>
                    Well, now that we've got the records and the player sorted, there is nothing stopping you from getting your collection started! Good luck and happy grooving! <br>~~sofia

        <p>I started my journey with records almost five years ago, and I can’t imagine stopping. It has been a hobby that takes my mind off of things, and gives me an outlet to express my interests. I have loved music since I was a little kid, and collecting records has become a new way for me to explore my love for music in a new and exciting way. I was first introduced to records from my parents, who have collected them since they were young, and kept them for all these years. I discovered them in our basement years ago, and the rest is history. Sifting through all their records, I saw some I recognized, and some I had never seen or heard in my life before, but I couldn’t wait to hear them. From there I got to work, researching what record players, where I could get them, but most importantly, how fast it would get here. After picking out a few of my parents records, I got to work looking for records from artists I knew and currently loved. And after all this time, I will never have enough records. And with each new record, my collection grows. While it is small in number, it is definitely mighty. My record collection is my pride and joy. Finding old classics is a steal for me, while discovering new artists that have their albums on vinyl lets me listen to them in a fun and new way. It is never a dull moment when collecting vinyl, and each new record shop I stumble upon makes me feel like a kid in candy shop, and I wouldn’t have it any other way. My journey collecting records is nowhere near over, and I’m so excited to see where it takes me in the future. This is my favorite hobby, and I’m so excited to let you to get to learn more about what it means to me!</p>
