            <h3>How Records Get Damaged</h3>
            <img src="/project6/images/page2.jpg" class="page2" alt="vinylrecord">
            <p>The two biggest damages that can happen to your records are scratches and warping. There is no way of fixing your record once it is damaged, so it is extremely important to prevent it from happening at all. If your record gets scratches, it will mess will the grooves in the record, making your record skip, and not play properly. Records can get scratched in a number of ways, but most of the time these scratches come from mishandling, careless removal and storage. Scratches can come from anywhere including the needle of the record player when being placed on the record. Records are very fragile, and any outside force can scratch the it very easily. Warping occurs from extra weight directly on the record, heat and direct sunlight. When records heat up the vinyl becomes soft and melts. This completely ruins the shape of the record and the grooves. <br>
                Vinyl that has  been scratched due to being stored improperly will affect the way the record sounds. Damaged records can also damage the needle of your record player, and vice versa. Scratches can lead to “skipping” which is when the needle is stuck at a certain groove and cannot move forward, usually making a very unpleasant sound. It is so important to properly store your vinyl records to ensure that they last long and sound great for as long as possible! Storing vinyl correctly is the first and most important step in protecting them from damage.

            <h3>Keeping Your Records Safe</h3>

                Now that you know all about what can happen when records arent taken care of, here are some tips to ensure that it doesn’t happen to you! 
                <ol>
                    <li>Safe storage is the number one way to ensure your records stay in good shape. Making sure they are always in the inner sleeve they came in, and inside the record jacket will prevent them from getting scratches when you arent using them.</li>
                    <li>You should always hold your records on the outermost edges, or on the inside where the paper is. Oil and dirt from your fingers could get inside the grooves if they are touches, which could in turn effect the sound they produce.</li> 
                    <li>When placing the needle on the record manually, it is important to do it very delicately, as too much pressure on the record from the needle can cause scratches in the groves, and could also break the needle of the record player. Dust is prone to get on your records, it is everywhere, but an important tip to clean any dust that can get stuck in the grooves is to wipe them with a carbon fiber record brush every once and a while.</li>
